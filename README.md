# What's In a Name?
### In A Name is an informative anagramizer!

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://inaname.streamlitapp.com)

### Enter a name or phrase and try to build a complete anagram one word at a time.  Even when they don't work out the words and phrases hidden in names are surprising to see!

### Built with Python and StreamLit, running on the StreamLit cloud.  The anagramizer relies on a corpus of english words, currently a subset of the words in Webster's Second International Dictionary, accessed through the Python english-words library.

#### Pulls Wikipedia article summaries and definitions from Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary to provide informative context for generated phrases.

### Examples: 
 - #### try the name **'Alec Guinness'**.  Choose, **'genuine'**, and then **'class'**.
 - #### try the name **'Jeremy Irons'**.  Choose, **'jerry'**, and then **'monies'**.

## Have fun!
