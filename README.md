# What's in a Name?
### An anagramizer

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://mpolinsky-anagramizer-main-deploy-7symnm.streamlitapp.com)

### Enter a name or phrase and try to build a complete anagram one word at a time.  Even when they don't work out the words and phrases hidden in names are surprising to see!

### Built with Python and StreamLit, running on the StreamLit cloud.  The anagramizer relies on a corpus of english words, currently a subset of the words in Webster's Second International Dictionary, accessed through the Python english-words library.

### For an example, try the name **'Alec Guinness'**.  Choose, **'genuine'**, and then **'class'**.

## Have fun!
