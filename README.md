# What's In a Name?
### In A Name is an informative anagramizer that lets you find the words hidden in names and phrases!

### Enter a name or phrase and try to build a complete anagram one word at a time.  Even when they don't work out the words and phrases hidden in names are surprising to see!

### Built with Python and StreamLit, running on the StreamLit cloud.  The anagramizer relies on a corpus of english words, currently a subset of the words in Webster's Second International Dictionary, accessed through the Python english-words library.

#### Pulls Wikipedia article summaries and definitions from Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary to provide informative context for generated phrases.

### For an example, try the name **'Alec Guinness'**.  Choose, **'genuine'**, and then **'class'**.

## Have fun!
